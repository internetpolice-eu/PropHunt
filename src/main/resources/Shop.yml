## Manage all ids for special items here, set to 0 if you dont want to use
# Unique items to PropHunt that have special effects
#
# Exmaple of use:
# FirstSeeker item is 339, there is an item with Id 339 in the ItemShop, this means that if the player
# buys the First Seeker item from the shop, they will get the special item as defined below
#
# For items, you must supply an amount
#
#
# The following config for the Items: would not give the player anything special, as the item 338 is not a
# unique PropHuntItem, so they would just recieve the item 338 when the game starts
#   1:
#     Name: First Seeker
#     Id: 338:1
